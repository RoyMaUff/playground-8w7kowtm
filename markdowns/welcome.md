# Welcome

This PHP course will lead you to build your own Mastermind game.  
You will need a basic knowledge of algorythm and PHP (conditions, iterations, array...etc).  
You will be ask to think about a way to transpose the games rules into an algorythm and to implement them in a PHP script.

At the end of the course, you will be granted access to the source code of a possible implementation.
